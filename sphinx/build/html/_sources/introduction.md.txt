# Introduction

The Open Source GIS Stack by [Kartoza](https://kartoza.com/en/) is maintained in the [kartoza / osgs](https://github.com/kartoza/osgs) repository. 

## What is the Open Source GIS Stack?

The platform presents the user with a geographical view of a country 
or region with the administrative units colour coded according to their
risk factors. Some other key features include:

* classification of risk into different scenarios and linking to 
  contingency plans based on those scenarios
* temporal view of factors and how they change over time
* side-by-side comparison of risk factors (indicators) using a map swiping tool
* ad hoc creation of indicators
* harvesters that can automatically update indicators from different data sources such 
  as web API's
* a complete and user friendly administration environment to manage the system
* role based user management
