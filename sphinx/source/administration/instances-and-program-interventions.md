# *Instances and Program Interventions*

1. *Signing In*:
In the top right-hand corner of the screen is the sign-in button. Here, you will sign in using your admin username and password. This process is the same for a staff user or an admin user.

2.  *Creating an instance*: 
Once you’ve signed in, you’ll be redirected back to the home page which contains the various instances that you can select. To create a new Instance, select the dropdown arrow next to your username and “click” on ‘Django Admin’. Once you’re on the ‘Site Administration’ page, “scroll” down until you find ‘Instances’. “Click” on the ‘+Add’ option on the right-hand side of the ‘Instances’ row. “Add” the name of the new instance, a description as well as the icon files and then “click” ‘Save’.

3. *Adding or Changing Icons*:

If there is an *instance* with no image available or you would like to change the current icon, follow these steps: start by selecting the dropdown arrow next to your username and “click” on ‘Django Admin’. Once you’re on the ‘Site Administration’ page, “scroll” down until you find ‘Instances’. “Select” the instance you would like to change and then “insert” the files for the ‘Icon’ and ‘White Icon’ of your choice. Once you’re happy with your selections, “click” ‘Save’.

To change or add icons to the *RIR dashboard panel* at the top of the screen, you will need to go to the ’Site Administration page. Under the group ‘Core’, you will see ‘Site Preferences’. “Click” on this option and then you will be redirected to a new page, “select” ‘Site Preferences’ again. Here you will be able to “change” or “edit the title as well as the icons. “Save” and “refresh” once you have made your edits.

The process of changing or adding the *‘Program Interventions’* icons is similar to what we have been doing previously, except for this time once we are on the ‘Site Administration’ page, “select“ ‘Programs’.  You will now have the option of choosing a specific program intervention. “Click” on the one you want to edit. You can add or change the title, description, or icons. “Select” ‘Save’ once you are happy with your edits.
