1. **Creating an instance**: 
Once you’ve signed in, you’ll be redirected back to the home page which contains the various instances that you can select. To create a new Instance, select the
dropdown arrow next to your username and “click” on ‘Django Admin’. Once you’re on the ‘Site Administration’ page, “scroll” down until you find ‘Instances’. 
“Click” on the ‘+Add’ option on the right-hand side of the ‘Instances’ row. “Add” the name of the new instance, a description as well as the icon files 
and then “click” ‘Save’. You also can add it on a category. To do it, just select the category or add new one by click ‘plus‘ icon.

2. **Change the order of category**:
Sometimes we need to change the order of category. For example from before, we need to change the ‘Test‘ category to most bottom. To do it, go to ‘Site Administration’ page,
scroll down to ‘Instance categories‘. There will be ‘order‘ column. Just change the number for the orders of category.
