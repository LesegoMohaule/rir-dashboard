After we change the scenario, we need to create a program so we can create program intervention.
To add or edit program, go to ‘Site Administration’ page, “select“ ‘Program’. In the form, you can fill name, icon and the white icon.

Now we need to add the program to an instance, so we can create intervention for the program on the instance for specific scenario. 
To do it, go to ‘Site Administration’ page, “select“ ‘Program instances’ and create new or edit existing one.
It will ask the instance and also the program. And also we need to add the program interventions that link to specific scenario.
