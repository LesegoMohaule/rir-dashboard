# Session tutorial

Access and sign in:

Access the platform here: https://staging.rir.kartoza.com . 

On the landing page you will see several dashboard instances. An Instance is the dashboard but configured for a specific region or counry for example Somalia which you will be looking at or have interest in. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163159336-a060f842-ff43-4149-a4ce-88beaef7b96c.png)

On the top right-hand side of the screen there is a drop down menu for links and a link to a sign in page. The links drop down menu is a quick way to access the documentation for using the platform and the different data and resources associated with the platform.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163159541-48367a42-c184-4573-84c8-9f9267b9aab0.png)

The most important of these as a user in the RIR documentation so that you can be fully equiped to use the platform. In the documentation section you can acess the a full user manual. For ecample the platform tour if you click on the link. Look through the User Documentation briefly.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163159830-34a9195b-1aed-47a3-970a-ab197bda597a.png)

If you click on the sign in link a page will open where you can add in your user name and password. Your credential are created for you by an administrator and may not be nessisray as a webuser you will still be able to interact with the platform without a login.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163160673-0fdb10a2-7a8e-4093-861c-da178cf0e8bd.png)

Sign in ia important as some data and work flows may only be available to named users who are signed into the platform. Once you are signed in your name will appear on the top right and depending on your admin privileges on the site there will be a drop down with the option to log out and reach the admin page if you are an administrator. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163162736-5d6ce187-d044-4bcf-a5a7-1de3f558c092.png)

## Dashboard Tour

Click on the instance labled Somalia and the dashboard will load and open. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163163356-c9e6b23f-02b9-4041-b51d-c9453610a6b3.png)

You will see I am still signed in and there are 3 options available to me on the bottom left if I now sign out they will disappear because as a web user I do not have access to some functionality. For this tour a web user status will work.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163163748-add19efd-78aa-47ab-87a8-13944fb4db58.png)

Lets tour the dashboard together, going to go from left to right across the screen showing what each button and panel does with a few simple examples. 

At the top left of the screen you will see by default the `Context Analysis` button which gives access to the indicator panel is selected and open.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163163874-4a2f018a-5453-4dcf-8ced-e19278273cdf.png)

Below this pannel on the top left hand side there is a pannel is called the Programme Interventions Panel. It contains a set of buttons to easily access key risk response indicators. If you click on the arrow next to the house symbol the tabs will extend an be labelled so you can see what each means, Health, Child Protection, Nutrition, Wash and Education.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163163962-6fb8b2ae-087a-4d8d-bfd5-df5b85e852d5.png)


For example the second button down with a picture of the caduceus/ medical symbol indicates Health. Once opened the pannel will show a report on the status of or degree to which the are interventions for that factor is helping as well as other informations like costing. 
click on each button to see the information for for each factor. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163164025-48adc99f-3ab4-46e8-8982-9d3ab84e1abb.png)

Click back on the `Context Analysis` button and observe the Indicator panel. This panel contains a list of indicators that relate to the main factors accounted for by the platform like health and nutrition for example. The panel is expanded by default but can be collapsed if you click on the tab labelled with a house in the right side if the panel to observe the map better. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163164267-b8ec21e5-5e1a-4e78-b713-54f3b82e2674.png)

Lets open the drop down for People in need by clicking in the triangle next to the label and select the box next to PIN- Child Protection a tick will appear and you will see the layer appear on the map with the darkening colour blue indicating a decrease in child protection per region. You can select sub sections (eg. best case to worstcase) of the layer by ticking or un-ticking the cases. An information panel will also open in the right hand side of the screen when an indicator is selected we will go through the information pannel in more detail shortly. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163164460-5ff8aa70-9321-4872-9d4b-2f5f161e97bb.png)

The The coloured circles next to each indicator show the current severity level for that indicator with blue being best case, yellow mid and red worst case. The case scenario will indicate if that region or state needs additional responses or interventions. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163168300-267af4f4-8f92-47f8-acf5-98204d4def9a.png)

You can access what we call traffic lights for the indicators by clicking on the arrow in the top right of the panel. This will expand the visible information on the severity level for example you can see that for our selected layer of Child Protection overall in Somalia the situation is worsening for children hence the yellow colour. This means that several regions need additional responses or support to protect vilnerable children. Click the triangle (now on the top right) again to see the map again. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163168402-9fcf7cd2-623c-4be5-96b5-8386a14b1396.png)

On the right-hand side of the map an information panel shows the severity case of the indicator for each region or district. For example in Adan Yabaal Child protection has a value of 3. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163168609-8b6b9f0d-a14c-4a93-b319-961c8d212ac8.png)

If you click on the region name in the information pannel it will show which region it is with an information window on the map and the panel will show all the indicators for that specified region and the severity of the situation for each indicator using colours. you can click on each indicator for more tetail but we will cover the information pannel more fully in the Information pannel section below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163168770-4dfb9f82-e554-4c43-8898-13cf44974d55.png)

You can also download the data of interest by clicking on the round symbol with the download arrow in it next to each indicator or at the top of the information panel for the selected indicator. You can get all the data for the instance if you click the download at symbol at the top of the indicator panel next to the Scenario title. This will give you a spreadsheet of the information that you can use outside of the platform.

## Layers

Lets explore the layers available to visualise and give context to the indicators. 

The context layers can be accessed by clicking on the button with 3 overlapping squares on it. There will be a list of options to choose from. 
Select ‘Access’ We can now see all the roads, airports and other access indicators. If you click on the drop-down triangle you can choose exactly what features you want to see.
Turn off everything except roads and ports. If you click on a point like a port you will be given information about that specific point in an information window. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163170091-bf0c87c0-d820-475f-81b5-96cfcb587a2f.png)

You can also change the base map behind the data if you click on the world icon in the panel. The default is an Openstreetmapp canvas. There is also a GEBCO grid basemap which is a global terrain model for ocean and land, a mapbox satellite basemap and an open topo basemap which is rendered from OSM and SRTM data.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77841514/163170223-6e492aaa-2318-4322-8aa2-a2cfcb4af014.png)

For example it may be useful to have a topographic map to visualise geographic features like mountains and rivers that could impede peoples movement into areas if you are reviewing the internal displacement of people. 

- turn on the Open Topo Map
- Navagate back to the indicator pannel
- Uncheck the child protection layer. 
- click the dropdown for Internal Displacement
- select the IDP Departure layer

Finally while we have the IDP data handy you can change the geography level of the indicators. By specifying country region or district in the menu on the bottom right of the map canvas.

Map Interactions: 

Lets now get into actually interacting with the Map. 

Activate the child protection indicator again (and deactivte depatures). You can zoom into and out of  the map by using your scroll wheel on your mouse or you can click hold down shift and draw a square around the area you whish to zoom in on. To pan on the map just click and drag the map around. 

Once you have zoomed and panned to an area or interest click on it and you will see an information window as we saw earlier. For more information click on the detail button and information will be shown in the information panel on the right. Click off the window to get out.

You can choose two indicators for comparison on the map. 

For example while child protection is selected lets see where there is program coverage for child protection in Somalia. 

Under the  program coverage indicator select child protection. You will see a slider appear and the layer names represented on each side on the bottom left and right of the screen. 

If you click on the middle toggle and drag you can see that in several of the regions in the north with the worse case scenario for child protection there are no active programs to combat the issue depicted in red. These would be ideal candidates to fund child releaf projects in. 

You can make the slide horizontal by clicking the map button at the bottom right of the map canvas. 

Finally there is a time laps bar that can show changes in data over time. (show time laps bar with mouse) 

A great example of this is the internal displacement of people. Lets turn of the child protection indicators and activate the IDP layer for departures. You can see where indicators are selected because the tab heading will be bolded. 

Now click the play button on the time bar and you will see the changes in what region people are leaving over time. People will leave due to conflict, drought and other reasons. This is also interesting to compare to IDP arrivals using the slide bar to see where people are leaving and what regions they are going to who may need extra financial and technical support. 

While the IDP Departures is open lets look at the last for options and functionalities on the information panel that I did not cover previously. 

If the Information panel in minimised click on the blue Info button that looks like a tab on the right side pannel to maximise and minimise it. 

Inside the information panel there is a summary of all the region/or districts and for example how many people departed that area because we are looking at the departures layer. 

There is also graphical representation of the scenarios in this case a pie chart showing the proportion of best case regions to worst case and the status quo. 

You can hover your mouse over the chart and interact with it. For example it will show that best case is the reality for 14 out of the 18 regions in a pop up label. 

At the top of the pannel nest to summary, we can also select the indicators option that will show the overall summary of the indicators status for the region selected if a region is selected. 

Thank you all for listening and please ask any questions or lets make some custom comparisons together.
