the platform and the information you can obtain from it, you need to understand how it works.

1. **Programme Interventions Panel**: 
    This group of buttons is used to navigate through the key areas of factors or indicators that the RIR platform accounts for. If you have admin status,
    more icons will be available within the panel, we will explore these additional buttons at a later stage. Each button will take you to a page
    as seen in the image below which will give you the intervention status of the geographic region for that specific factor. The factors in order
    from top to bottom are; education, child protection, nutrition, wash, and education. To return to the dashboard, click on the "context 
    analysis" icon which is represented as a little home symbol.

2. **The Indicator Panel**: 
     This panel contains a list of indicators that relate to the factors accounted for by the platform. The coloured circles next to each indicator
     show the current severity level for that indicator within the specific geographic region. The indicators are arranged in groups that have an 
     overall severity level for that group next to the group name. The entire collection of indicators is also given an overall status which is displayed at the top of the          list.
     An in-depth tour of the indicators and how they work will follow.

6. **Map**:
     The map displays a geographic area based on the instant being used. In this case, itâ€™s Somalia. The information that is displayed on the map is determined
     by the layers that are selected as well the factors that have been selected within the indicator panel. A complete guide of the map and accompanying 
     interactions will be available in a document to follow.

7. **The Info Button**:
     The info button expands a panel that contains a summary of the severity of the selected indicators in different locations within the geographic area.

9. **Graphical Representation**:
     This pie chart illustrates the severities of the selected indicators for the whole geographical area or instant. This chart gives you the cumulative 
     total of each severity out of the total number of regions or districts (depending on your settings in the geography level panel). To find out how many 
     regions or districts fall within a specific severity level, run your mouse over that area of the pie chart.
