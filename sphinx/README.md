To prepare your documentation build environment do:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run:

make html

Docs will be generated into the top level docs folder in this repo.

See https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.html# 
for myst syntax which is used in this implementation.

When writing docs, please use markdown execpt for the index files which
need to be in RsT.
