1.	**Geography Level Arrangement**: Below the ‘Program Interventions’ panel are three icons; ‘Indicator Management’, ‘Geography Management’, and ‘Instance Management’. 
	  	 “Click” on the ‘Geography Management’ icon. You will be redirected to the ‘Geography View’ map page and you will see that in the top right corner there is a button
		 for ‘Level Management’. “Select” this button. Now you will be able to rearrange the geography level by clicking on a degree and dragging to your desired 			location.

2.	**Adding a Geography level**: Let’s start in  ‘Site Administration’. “Scroll” down to ‘Geometry Level names’ and “select” ‘+Add’. “Add” the name and description 
	of the geometry level you want to add and save your work.
