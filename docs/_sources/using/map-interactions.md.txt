## Map Interactions

This document covers how the user can interact with the map displayed in the RIR dashboard and how the user can navigate around to perform different functions
and obtain different information.

1. **Moving Around the Map**:
To pan around the map, the user needs to click down with their mouse and drag the map around. The map will continue to pan for as long as the mouse is clicked in. 
To make the map stop moving, release your mouse.

2.	**Zooming In and Out**:
There are two ways to zoom in and out. The first being that the user can use their scroll on their mouse to zoom in and out. This is the easier of the two methods.
The second method can be used for when the user is looking to zoom into a specific area. This method requires the user to click shift and then drag a square around the
area they would like to focus in on. If the user is using a scroll pad and not a mouse, they can zoom out by bringing their fingers together and zoom out by moving 
them away from each other on the pad.

3.	** Information Display Window **:
To gain instant information on a specific area within the map, click on that area with your mouse. By clicking on an area, a popup window with information 
related to your selected layers for that area will be displayed on the screen. This action will also change the info window from the ‘summary’ tab
to the  ‘indicators’ tab. You can also view more details by clicking on ‘details’ in the popup window. This will also change the info window’s tab to the ‘details’ tab.

4.	**Switching Between Factors**: 
If the user has two factors selected to display on the map, they will see the name and severity levels on the bottom right and left of the screen.
To move between the two sets of data drag the vertical line, that extends from the top of the screen to the bottom, left to right. This feature allows 
the user to analyse more than one indicator at a time without having to deselect and select another factor.

5.	 **Timelapse Bar**:
The timelapse bar will show you the severity of the selected indicator over a period of time. As the map and the info panel change, the corresponding date for
that data will be displayed within the bar. To initiate the time lapse, click on the play button. Click stop to end it.

By clicking on the little map icon at the bottom left of the screen, the user can swap the location of the second indicator selected as well as the options
to have that data displayed on a country, region, or district level.
