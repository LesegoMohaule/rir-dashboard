# Platform Tour

The RIR platform monitors health, child protection, nutrition, wash and education in specific geographic regions. To fully understand 
the plaform and the information you can obtain from it, you need to understand how it works.

1. **Programme interventions panel**: 
    This group of buttons is used to navigate through the key areas or factors that the RIR platform accounts for. If you have admin status,
    more icons will be available within the panel, we’ll explore these additional buttons at a later stage. Each button will take you to a page
    as seen in the image below which will give you the intervention status of the geographic region for that specific factor. The factors in order
    from top to bottom are education, child protection, nutrition, wash, and education. To return     to the dashboard, click on the context 
    analysis icon which has a little home symbol.

2. **The indicator panel**: 
     This panel contains a list of indicators that relate to the factors accounted for by the platform. The coloured circles next to each indicator
     shows the current severity level for that indicator within the specific gegraphic region. The indicators are arranged in groups which have an 
     overall severity level for that group. The entire collection of indicators is also given an overall status which is displayed at the top of the list.
     An in depth tour of the indocatores and how they work will be compiled in a document following the platform tour.

3. **The indicator icon**:
     This button expands and collapses the indicator panel as illustrated in the image below.

4. **The layers icon**:
     By clicking on this icon, you expand the layers panel. This panel is where you can select or deselect the layers you want to be visible on the map canvas.
     The layers that you have visible should coincide with the information you are trying to obtain from the platform.

5. **The base map icon**:
     To expand or collapse the basemap panel, click on this icon. When expanded, you will be able to choose which basemap you would like to be displayed
     on your canvas extent.

6. **Map**:
     The map displays a geographic are based on the instant being used. In this case it’s Somalia. The information that is displayed on the map is determined
     by the layers that are selected as well the factors that have been selected within the indicator panel. A complete guide of the map and accompanying 
     interactions will be available in a document to follow.
     
7. **The info button**:
     The info button expands a panel which contains a summary of the severity of the selected indicators in different locations within the geographic area. 
     It also has an ‘indicators’ option to select which illustrates the severity of all the factors for a specific location within the geographic area,
     this location can be selected by using your mouse and simply clicking on the area of interest.

8. **Geography level panel**:
     This panel allows you to view the area of interest at a country, region, and district level.

9. **Graphical representation**:
     This pie chart illustrates the severities of the selected indicators for the whole geographical area or instant. This chart gives you the cumulative 
     total of each severity out of the total number or regions or districts (depending on your settings in the geography level panel). To find out how many 
     regions or districts fall within a specific severity level, run your mouse over that area of the pie chart.

10. **Timelapse bar**:
      The timelapse bar will show you the severity of the selected indicators over a period of time. As the map and the info panel change, the corresponding date
      for that data will be displayed within the bar. To imitate the time lapse, click on the play button. 
      
11. **Links button**
      If you click on the links button, a dropdown menu appears. These are the various links to the different servers that the RIR platform connects to.
