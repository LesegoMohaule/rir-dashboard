# User Showcase <br> <br>
The RIR platform is a situational awareness platform to monitor health, child protection, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene as well as education in a geographic region. To fully understand the platform and the information you can obtain from it, you need to understand how it works. <br> <br>
## Session outline <br> <br>
